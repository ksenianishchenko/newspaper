# NewsPaper
NewsPaper is a 'microblogging' system that allows authenticated users to send and receive short posts, following other users, leave comments, likes, and retweet posts. Posts can be up to 140 characters long and can include links to relevant websites and resources. I worked on this full-stack (React + Rails technology stack) project in a team of two developers.
